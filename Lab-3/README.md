# Lab-3 Watson Studio Data Refinery Lab

## Introduction
This lab will introduce the Data Refinery.  Data Refinery is a self-service data preparation tool for data scientists, data engineers, and business analysts. Data Refinery provides profiling, visualization, and a robust set of transforms to prepare data for analytics purposes.  We will continue to use the 3 Trafficking data sets in this lab to demonstrate data profiling, data visualization, and data preparation capabilities of the Data Refinery tool. Note the datasets use simulated data. 

## Objectives 

The goal of the lab is for the users to gain familiarity with the features of the Data Refinery. We will perform the following Data Refinery tasks: <br>
	Create a new Data Flow <br>
	Profile the data <br>
	Visualize the data to gain a better understanding <br>
	Prepare the data for modeling <br>
	Run the sequence of data preparation operations on the entire data set.
