# Lab-8: DevOps Lab 

## Introduction:

In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Machine Learning GUI to train, evaluate, and deploy a Watson Machine Learning model based on the Titanic dataset. You will then deploy a web application that calls the Watson Machine Learning model. 

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Machine Learning GUI.  
2. Train/Evaluate a machine learning model
3. Deploy a machine learning model. 
4. Deploy a Python Flask web application that we will configure to "call" the deployed machine learning model.  
5. Configure the application to connect to the machine learning service. 
6. Update the code in the application to specify the endpoint of the deployed model, and use DevOps to build and re-deploy the application. 
7. Run the application to demonstrate the use of the deployed machine learning model to score the survivability of a Titanic passenger.
