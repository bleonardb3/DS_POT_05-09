# Lab-5: Machine Learning using SparkML

## Introduction:
In this lab, you will use SparkML in Watson Studio to run generated travel data through a machine learning algorithm, automatically tune the algorithm, and load the data into a DB2 Warehouse database.

## Objectives:
Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Connect to a database and read data used for machine learning.
2. Identify labels and transform data.
3. Conduct feature engineering for algorithm data.
4. Declare a machine learning model.
5. Setup the Pipeline for data transforms and training.
6. Train the data.
7. Show and evaluate machine learning results.
8. Automatically tune machine learning results.
9. Score data and load  into a new DB2 table. 

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Click on the hamburger icon, then click on `Projects`, and then `Watson Studio Labs` (or whatever you named the project)

1. Click the `From URL` tab under `New Notebook`.
1. Give the notebook a name in the `Name` field, for example `Machine Learning with SparkML` and optionally you can give it a description.
1. In the Notebook URL field, use `https://github.com/bleonardb3/DS_POT_02-07/blob/master/Lab-2/Machine%20Learning%20with%20SparkML.ipynb`.
1. Change the environment to be `Default Spark Python 3.5 XS (Driver with 1vCPU...`, then click the `Create Notebook` button on the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 5.  Follow the instructions in the notebook.
